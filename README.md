# MEST BDT Project

## A project to help organizations manage their companies in cohorts and programs

This project is a full-stack application designed to assist organizations in managing their companies through a structured system of cohorts and programs. It provides a comprehensive solution for tracking, organizing, and overseeing the progress of companies within various developmental stages.

The application is built with a modern technology stack, featuring a robust backend API and a user-friendly web interface. It is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of organizational needs.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - A React framework for building user interfaces.
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Monorepo Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo, containing both the backend and frontend applications in a single repository. This approach simplifies dependency management and streamlines the development workflow.

- **`/api`**: This directory contains the NestJS backend application. It is responsible for handling business logic, data persistence, and serving the API.
- **`/web`**: This directory contains the Next.js frontend application. It provides the user interface for interacting with the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to set up and run both the backend and frontend applications.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (v6 or later)

### Backend (`/api`)

1. **Navigate to the `api` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd api
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

The backend application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend (`/web`)

1. **Navigate to the `web` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Documentation

The backend API is documented using Swagger. Once the backend application is running, you can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

## Testing

### Backend (`/api`)

To run the tests for the backend application, navigate to the `/api` directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the unit and integration tests for the backend application.

### Frontend (`/web`)

There are currently no tests configured for the frontend application.
